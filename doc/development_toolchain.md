# Development Workflows, Tools & Environments

This document exists to give new developers a running start into the tools used by existing developers and how the development process can be made easier using helpful tools for each job. When you find a useful workflow, tool or environment setup that helps you in your development process, please consider adding it here. Existing developers might also like to learn about new tools that make engineering more efficient or simply more fun!

## Code Editor's Corner

This section is all about exchanging hints & findings about editor tools or integrated development environments (IDEs) that have been found useful.
Here are some editors commonly used in this project:

- Vim, Emacs, Nano & other text mode editors - allow quick edits even through a remote ssh connection
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - one of the most widely used editors as it is highly extendable and fast to learn.
- Sublime - fast and loved by many
- Pycharm Community Edition / Webstorm - powerful IDE but closed source
